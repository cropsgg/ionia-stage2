## Ionia Stage 2 – Project Plan

### Overview
Ionia Stage 2 is a personalised Learning Management System (LMS) designed to enhance classroom activities for schools operating on a franchise model. The platform focuses on delivering personalized homework tailored to individual student needs and learning preferences, aiming to improve academic performance and cater to each student's unique potential. A core USP is its robust subjective assessment capability, addressing a significant gap in the current EdTech landscape. The system also provides tools for teachers to reduce chaotic workloads, allowing them to concentrate on learning outcomes rather than administrative burdens.

The project is broken into incremental **stages**. Each stage lists:

*   **Goal** – what the stage delivers.
*   **Key Tasks** – detailed engineering/product work required.
*   **Dependencies** – stages that must be complete first.
*   **Questions / Decisions** – open issues to resolve.
*   **Answers / Status** – decided items.

Roles acknowledged by the platform:
*   **Student** (school student)
*   **Teacher** (subject teacher, may teach multiple classes)
*   **Class-Teacher** (pastoral owner of one class)
*   **School Admin / Principal**
*   **Super-Admin** (Ionia dev team)

| Goal                  | Augment the analytics and reporting features (from Stage 5) to incorporate detailed metrics and insights derived from the advanced personalization engine, providing a deeper understanding of student learning journeys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Key Tasks             | 1.  **New Personalization Metrics Integration:**<br>    *   Identify and integrate new metrics into dashboards and reports, such as: <br>        - Student engagement with different types of personalized content.<br>        - Progress along adaptive learning pathways.<br>        - Effectiveness of personalization strategies for individual students or groups.<br>        - Alignment with inferred learning preferences.
                        | 2.  **Update Dashboards & Reports:**<br>    *   Modify existing dashboards (Student, Teacher, School Admin) to visualize these new personalization-focused metrics.<br>    *   Create new report templates if necessary.
                        | 3.  **Teacher Insights from Personalization:**<br>    *   Provide teachers with actionable insights based on personalization data (e.g., "Student X responds well to visual explanations for Topic Y").
                        | 4.  **Retro-fitting Historical Data (If Feasible):**<br>    *   Assess the possibility of applying new personalization analytics to existing student data to show trends over time (may depend on data compatibility).
                        | 5.  **User Communication for New Insights:**<br>    *   Develop a plan to inform and educate users (especially teachers and students) about the new insights available and how to interpret them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Cross-Stage Dependency Map (New)
```
Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 → Stage 4 → Stage 5 → Stage 6
                                     ↓         ↓       ↓
                                     (Stage 4 feeds into Stage 7 & 8)
                                     Stage 7 (Content Library, uses Stage 3)
                                     ↓
                                     Stage 8 (Personalization Engine, uses Stage 4 data) → Stage 9 (Enhanced Reporting)
```
*(Note: Stage 6 (Communication) can run somewhat in parallel after Stage 1 & 4 are stable. Stage 7 (Content Library) primarily depends on Stage 3 but is used by Stage 4. Stage 8 depends heavily on a mature Stage 4.)*

### Next Steps
1.  **Review and Finalize Detailed Stage 1 Tasks:** Confirm technical details for Core Architecture & Auth.
2.  **UI/UX Design Mockups:** Develop initial mockups for the Student Portal and Admin/Teacher Portal reflecting the new focus.
3.  **Define Personalization Engine API (by Ionia Team):** Crucial for Stage 8 planning.
4.  **Begin Stage 1 Development:** Start coding core architecture, tenancy, and authentication mechanisms.
5.  **Regular Stakeholder Reviews:** Schedule bi-weekly or monthly reviews to demonstrate progress and gather feedback.
