      questionType: "single_choice",
      options: [
        { text: "3", isCorrect: false },
        { text: "4", isCorrect: true },
        { text: "5", isCorrect: false }

      difficultyLevel: "easy"
    }
  ],
  settings: {
    maxAttempts: 2,
    shuffleQuestions: true,
    showResults: "after_end"
  }
};
```

```javascript
// Start attempt
const attempt = await startQuizAttempt(quizId, { password: "optional" });

// Submit answers
await submitAnswer(quizId, attemptId, {
  questionId: "question_id",
  answer: "selected_option",
  timeSpent: 30
});

// Submit quiz
await submitQuizAttempt(quizId, attemptId);
```

## Error Handling

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on frequently queried fields (schoolId, classId, studentId)
- Efficient aggregation pipelines for analytics
- Proper pagination for large result sets

### Caching Strategy
- Quiz data caching for active quizzes
- Student enrollment data caching
- Statistics caching with TTL

### Security Measures
- Input validation for all quiz data
- XSS protection for text answers
- Rate limiting on quiz endpoints
- Attempt validation to prevent cheating
